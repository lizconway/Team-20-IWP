Code Requirements

Hi folks

Could you do the following when committing code to repository

1.  Good comments within code with full description brief.
2.  Click on Fork (top right-hand-corner symbol) this creates your own copy of the code - which means you do not touch the master file!
3.  Download this copy make whatever changes needed and save code with version no.s, Github will keep track of versions.
4.  There is a process with github check out: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fKg7e37bQE this is a short tutorial giving you idea of how to use it!

Thanks folks!

Liz
